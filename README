This script simplifies usage of the :grep-command and the navigation
through search results and search history.

To start search for the word under the cursor or for the visually
selected text press <Leader>gr. If there is no word under the cursor,
you will be prompted for a search-string. To be prompted for a
search-string anyway pressing <Leader>ga will do it.

Files will be searched in the actual directory. The file pattern
can be defined by a global variable, its default is
"*.c *.h *.cpp *.hpp" (yes, this script is primarily for
programmers :-) )

To show search-results open quickfix-window with :copen.
To navigate through the occurrences press <F6> or <F7>.
To bring back results of older or newer search-sessions press
<S-F6> or <S-F7>.
